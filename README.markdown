# Vim Script/Plug-in Installer

## Usage

Just copy the script to your the base directory of your project's git repo.
Push that up and then people can easily update and install your project by
running:

`rake` or if they just want to install it with `rake install`.

If you're on a system that doesn't have git installed and you got the project
from a compressed version of project then use the commit with the tag:
`without-git-ls`.
